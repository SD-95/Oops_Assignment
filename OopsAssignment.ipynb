    "\n",
    "      1. single Inheritance       :  when a children class having only one parent class.\n",
    "      2. multi level Inheritance  :  creating a chain of inheritance across multiple levels.\n",
    "      3. multiple Inheritance     :  One child class may inherit the property of multiple parent class.\n",
    "      4. diamond problem          :  This occurs when a class inherit from 2 or more than 2 class will lead to ambiguity in execution of method.\n",
    "      5. hierarchical Inheritance :  multiple more than two child class\n",
    "      6. hybrid Inheritance       :  multiple types of combination of different inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "  -> it refers to an object taking several forms depending on the methods / data.\n",
    "  -> in Oops concept Polymorphism takes places in two ways\n",
    "      1. method overloading  :  method overloading happen in the same class.\n",
    "      2. method overriding   :  method in parent class and child class method will be executed.\n",
    "  -> in python does not support  true method overloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "  -> This is bundling data/attributes and methods/functions that operate on the data into a single unit, called an object.\n",
    "  -> Encapsulation restricts direct access to some of an object's components and only exposes a controlled interface to interact with them.\n",
    "  -> it having access modifiers\n",
    "     1. public \n",
    "     2. private (__)\n",
    "     3. protected (_)\n",

    "Abstraction:\n",

    "  -> Concept of hiding complex implimentation\n",
    "  -> hiding unneeeded details and exposing the required\n",
    "  -> abstract class can not be instantiated (can not make object)\n",
    "  -> abstract class should always be subclassed.\n",
    "  -> abstract class may contain methods that are just declared and not implemented in abstract class itself, subclass are responsible for implementing these abstract methods\n",
    "  -> abstraction can be achieved using abstract class\n",
